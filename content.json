The first thing you will spot from the enemy is the blasting light from their jet engines. Inspired by the FPS game mode Oddball, the one who holds the payload the longest wins. You will, in a flock of other fighters, hunt down the payload holder, shoot him down, take the payload, shake the flock off your tail!",
