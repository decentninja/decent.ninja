                    <p>This is an experiment. I wanted to test if readability of regular text could be improved in the same way code is by highlighting structures in text with colours. So I wrote a syntax highlighter for text, colouring suffixes, vowels and numbers. It failed and is maybe even harder to read but it is a cool experiment.</p>

                    <p>As a large school project, I together with Daniil Pintjuk, Viktor Palmkvist and Marcel Enguehard built a text-information-extractor. It reads Wikipedia articles and builds the info-boxes on the side with information such as date of birth and residence for people-articles, but it is general and can be made to work with any article type. It trains Hidden Markov Models with data from articles that already have info-boxes and learns what sentence structure usually prefixes and postfixes the information we are searching for. It is written in C++ and Python. </p>

                    <p>I created the GUI for Amnesty, a complex relational database for permission tracking at the Computer Science student chapter at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The system tracks students, what roles they have, what permissions the roles have and what position each role has in the organisation. It can be viewed from multiple angles depending on the action and the frontend reflects these actions. As the system is very complex, the documentation had to be included into the gui with warnings, explanations and footnotes. Amnesty is written in Ruby on Rails.</p>
