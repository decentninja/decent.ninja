                  <h3>AirGolf - Physics Game</h3>
                  <p>AirGolf is a game I designed and programmed to be able to show a complete experience created by me. It is a 3D physics game with a mix of golf and air hockey. With the low friction dynamics of air hockey and interesting physics puzzles. I created the first version in Unreal Engine but later ported it to Unity. All design, assets, 3D models, code, animations, and shaders are written by me.</p>

                    <p>Looptime is a prototype 3D multiplayer shooter for the web. It features free-form jumps in time, grandfather paradoxes, and other similar temporal shenanigans. The project has fantastic algorithms but ran into something of a visualization problem, it is easy to get lost with all the time jumps. Built together with my friend and classmate Viktor Palmkvist.</p>

With tasks ranging from cryptography to Unix, programming, security and databases. 2015 I lead the creation of the competition and put together a great team who helped me develop and judge the contest. I designed the majority of the challenges and designed it's frontend website. The biggest reward from this project was the laughs and activity during lunch every day when over 200 students waited with anticipation for the next challenge and then the complete silence ones it was released.</p>

At the game jam it won the only prize to be won, the public vote. It is made in Unity.</p>

In Chamaterion, you control an impressive chameleon who has the power to transform himself into different kinds of materials helping him run the course. Even if it is buggy and unfinished, it puts a smile on players faces, and we learned a great lot about project management.</p>

                  <p>Hungry Twins is an Ipad game built in 12 hours at a game jam by me and my friends Emil Meiton and Johan Widegren. In this game, you try to feed two twins frantically by spinning the table to put food in front of them. You have to use the centripetal effect to place the food in the correct spot but still keep it on the table. The theme of the game jam was "duality" and it was arranged by Rovio and Swedish Game Awards at VIC KTH. Our game won the first price.</p>
