                  <h3>Fugam VR - VR Game</h3>
                  <p>A fast paced, mood focused, aerial dogfighting game in VR. You are tasked to fly swiftly, in low altitude terrain, during the night. The first thing you will spot from the enemy is the blasting light from their jet engines. Inspired by the FPS game mode Oddball, the one who holds the payload the longest wins. You will, in a flock of other fighters, hunt down the payload holder, shoot him down, take the payload, shake the flock off your tail!</p>

                  <p>To experiment with VR outside of games, we created an Industrial Robot simulation and programming environment for the Vive. My contribution was the interaction programming, robot rigg, and robot texture.</p>

                  <p>You are God is my second VR experience, it was build as a group project in an advanced graphics course. It features destructible buildings, smoke particle effects, a PBR asset (Physically Based Rendering), and ragdolls among many other graphical achievements. My main task in this project was to lead and organize the work, design and implement the VR interaction, teach Unity and Git to the group members, create, model and texture the PBR Vive controllers. We got a chance to demo You are God on Comic Con Stockholm which was an experience in and of itself, seeing players from all ages dive into our experience, new and interesting interactions.</p>

                  <p>Spaceception is a room scale VR strategy game where you take control of an armada of ships and fight aliens. My focus of this experience was to learn the ropes of VR design and do something that took full advantage of what VR brings, great depth perception and, in the case of the HTC Vive, accurately tracked motion controllers. A video would not make it justice, but please try it out if you have an HTC Vive or other Steam VR compatible headset and controllers.</p>

                  <p>The Blind Depth is a mobile submarine game where all feedback is auditory; your task is to drive the underwater vehicle through a invisible path. Me and Mattias LÃ¶nnerberg created the game for a study of human hearing perception in a sound interaction course. My main takeaways of the projects is an immense respect for the utility of sound to convey complex information such as position, movement, and state.</p>

With the low friction dynamics of air hockey and interesting physics puzzles. I created the first version in Unreal Engine but later ported it to Unity. All design, assets, 3D models, code, animations, and shaders are written by me.</p>

                  <p>Djulkalendern is the student Computer Science Chapter's annual countdown to Christmas. Every day a new computer challenge is presented. With tasks ranging from cryptography, Unix, programming, security, and databases. In 2015 I led the creation of the competition and put together a great team who helped me develop and judge the contest. I took it upon myself to design the majority of the challenges and constructed a fully functioning text-based multi-user dungeon that was featured in multiple challenges. The biggest reward from this project was the laughs and activity during lunch every day when over 200 students waited with anticipation for the next challenge and then the complete silence ones it was released.</p>

                  <p>During a weekend at Kings Stockholm office I, together with an excellent team, created a game called Vogon Tennis. The game is mighty fun and creates great moments of excitement when the ball swing around the suns gravity field, or goes into slow motion and one of the player just barely reaches the ball. At the game jam it won the only prize to be won, the public vote. It is made in Unity.</p>

In Chamaterion, you control an impressive chameleon who has the power to transform himself into different kinds of materials helping him run the course. Even if it is buggy and unfinished, it puts a smile on players faces, and we learned a great lot about project management.</p>

                  <p>In a visualization course at KTH, I together with seven other classmates constructed a real-time display of the code collaboration tool Git. Git is a tool that otherwise lives in the programmers terminal windows and are unapproachable by nondevelopers. We hope that our visualization GitSpace can give a glimpse of insight into the programming workflow for uninitiated. Gitspace won a Cawards for technical excellence in 2016.

                  <p>Hungry Twins is an Ipad game built in 12 hours at a game jam by me and my friends Emil Meiton and Johan Widegren. In this game, you try to feed two twins frantically by spinning the table to put food in front of them. You have to use the centripetal effect to place the food in the correct spot but still keep it on the table. The theme of the game jam was "duality", and it was arranged by Rovio and Swedish Game Awards at VIC KTH. Our game won the first price.</p>

              <h3>Rovio SGA Game Jam First Price</h3>
              <h4>Rovio and Swedish Game Awards</h4>
              <time>2016</time>
              <p>Hungry Twins is an Ipad game built in 12 hours at a game jam by me and my friends Emil Meiton and Johan Widegren. In this game, you try to feed two twins frantically by spinning the table in order to put food in front of them. You have to use the centripetal effect to place the food in the correct spot but still keep it on the table. The theme of the game jam was "duality", and it was arranged by Rovio and Swedish Game Awards at VIC KTH. Our game won the first price.</p>

                <h3>Cawards 2016 Technical Excellence</h3>
                <h4>Visualiseringscenter C</h4>
                <time>2016</time>
                <p>In a visualization course at KTH, I, together with seven other classmates constructed a real-time display of the code collaboration tool Git. Git is a tool that otherwise lives in the programmer's terminal window and is unapproachable by nondevelopers. We hope that our visualization GitSpace can give a glimpse of insight into the programming workflow for uninitiated. Gitspace won a Cawards for technical excellence in 2016. Gitspace is written in Unity3D, Python and JavaScript.</p>
