So I wrote a syntax highlighter for text, colouring suffixes, vowels and numbers. It failed and is maybe even harder to read but it is a cool experiment.</p>

                    <p>As a large school project, I together with Daniil Pintjuk, Viktor Palmkvist and Marcel Enguehard built a text-information-extractor. It reads Wikipedia articles and builds the infoboxes on the side with information such as date of birth and residence for people-articles, but it is general and can be made to work with any article type. It trains Hidden Markov Models with data from articles that already have info-boxes and learns what sentence structure usually prefixes and postfixes the information we are searching for. It is written in C++ and Python. </p>

                    <p>I created the GUI for an application called Amnesty, a sophisticated relational database for permission tracking at the Computer Science student chapter at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The system tracks students, what roles they have, what permissions the roles have and what position each role has in the organisation. It can be viewed from multiple angles depending on the action and the front end reflects these actions. As the system is very complex, the documentation had to be included into the GUI with warnings, explanations and footnotes. Amnesty is written in Ruby on Rails.</p>

                <h3>Cawards 2016 Technical Excellence</h3>
                <h4>Visualiseringscenter C</h4>
                <time>2016</time>
                <p>In a visualization course at KTH, I together with seven other classmates constructed a real-time display of the code collaboration tool Git. Git is a tool that otherwise lives in the programmers terminal windows and are unapproachable by nondevelopers. We hope that our visualization GitSpace can give a glimpse of insight into the programming workflow for uninitiated. Gitspace won a Cawards for technical excellence in 2016. Gitspace is written in Unity3D, Python and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>You can find more information on GitSpace and follow its development on its <a href="https://decentninja.github.io/gitspace_website/">Official website</a> and the <a href="http://www.cawards.se/">Cawards</a>.</p>
