                  <h3>AirGolf - Physics Game</h3>
                  <p>AirGolf is a game I designed and programmed to be able to show a complete experience created by me. It is a 3D physics game with a mix of golf and air hockey. With the low friction dynamics of air hockey and interesting physics puzzles. I created the first version in Unreal Engine but later ported it to Unity. All design, assets, 3D models, code, animations, and shaders are written by me.</p>

                    <p>Looptime is a prototype 3D multiplayer shooter for the web. It features free-form jumps in time, grandfather paradoxes, and other similar temporal shenanigans. The project has fantastic algorithms but ran into something of a visualization problem, it is easy to get lost with all the time jumps. Built together with my friend and classmate Viktor Palmkvist.</p>

                <h3>#1 Spotify AI Hockey Challange</h3>
                <h4>Spotify Street team</h4>
                <time>2012</time>
                <p>The task was to write a Java AI-hockey-team in 5 hours to later compete that evening against 24 other teams in simulated hockey matches. Our team BreakForWhile comprised of me, Per Classon and Simon Lindholm won the competition.</p>
                <p>The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/perclasson/breakforwhile">GitHub</a>.</p>
